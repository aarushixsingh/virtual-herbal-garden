            <h3>Tulsi (Holy Basil)</h3>
            <p>Tulsi has been found to protect organs and tissues against chemical stress from industrial pollutants and heavy metals, and physical stress from prolonged physical exertion, ischemia, physical restraint and exposure to cold and excessive noise. Tulsi has also been shown to counter metabolic stress through normalization of blood glucose, blood pressure and lipid levels, and psychological stress through positive effects on memory and cognitive function and through its anxiolytic and anti-depressant properties. Tulsi's broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, which includes activity against a range of human and animal pathogens, suggests it can be used as a hand sanitizer, mouthwash and water purifier as well as in animal rearing, wound healing, the preservation of food stuffs and herbal raw materials and traveler's health. </p>

            <h3>Neem</h3>
            <p>People most frequently use neem in hair and skin care products. Some people take neem extract capsules, but there is not currently enough research to say whether they have any medical benefits.

                The oil is yellow or brown and smells of garlic or sulfur. If ingested, it has a strong bitter taste.
                
                Little research is available on neem’s effect on hair health, but anecdotal evidence suggests that it may be helpful for:
                
                Dandruff: Neem is a popular ingredient in several anti-dandruff shampoos. Although there has been no research to support its use, neem is an anti-inflammatory and an anti-microbial, which may help reduce the symptoms associated with dandruff.
                Lice: The results of a small study indicated that neem is an effective anti-lice and anti-nit agent. The study only tested 12 children with lice, but all were completely lice- and nit-free after treatment with a neem-based shampoo. No lice were present for 7–10 days after treatment, and there were no side effects.</p>

            <p>
                Giloy (Tinospora cordifolia) is a climbing shrub that grows on other trees, from the botanical family Menispermaceae. The plant is native to India but also found in China and tropical areas of Australia and Africa.
                It’s considered an essential herbal plant in Ayurvedic and folk medicine, where people use it as a treatment for a wide range of health conditions
                Giloy might be helpful for those with diabetes or who are at risk of heart disease.

Several studies done on animals and on cells in the lab show that giloy reduces blood sugar by making cells less insulin resistant. It also may reduce cholesterol levels in lab animals.
